# AppUpdater

Kotlin Multiplatform library for managing your app's updates!

Heavily inspired by [@javiersantos' AppUpdater library](https://github.com/javiersantos/AppUpdater),
this library offers a more customisable (and cross-platform) approach of managing your app's updates.

At the moment, the library is currently in work-in-progress.

## Features

* Ability to use the same library across multiple platforms
* Concise Kotlin DSL for setting how the updater would work
* TODO
